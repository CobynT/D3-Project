       1. INTRO & DATASET
  ========================================== -->
  <p class="section-label">Part 1 – Motivation & Questions</p>
  <h2>1. Motivation and Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    I chose an NBA dataset because I’ve always been fascinated with the combination of
    sports and statistics. One of the most common debates in basketball is:
    <strong>“When do players actually peak, and when does their game start to decline?”</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    To explore this question, I used a Kaggle dataset containing historical NBA player
    data. The <span class="code">nba_players.csv</span> file includes attributes such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="code">age</span> – player age</li>
    <li><span class="code">gp</span> – games played</li>
    <li><span class="code">pts</span> – points per game</li>
    <li><span class="code">reb</span> – rebounds per game</li>
    <li><span class="code">ast</span> – assists per game</li>
    <li><span class="code">team_abbreviation</span>, <span class="code">season</span>, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Initial Questions</h3>

  <p>
    My main big-picture question was:
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    • At what age do NBA players reach their peak performance, and when do they start to decline?
  </strong></p>

  <p>
    As I explored the data, related questions came up:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      How does the peak age differ for specific stats? For example, do points, rebounds,
      and assists peak at the same age?
    </li>
    <li>
      When a player scores less as they get older, do other stats (like assists) increase
      because they may pass more instead of scoring?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is there a clear “peak age” for each stat, or is the decline more gradual?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- =========================================
       2. DESIGN PROCESS
  ========================================== -->
  <p class="section-label">Part 2 – Design Process</p>
  <h2>3. Design Process & Iterations</h2>

  <h3>3.1 First Prototype</h3>
  <p>
    I started with a very simple design: a <strong>single bar chart</strong> showing
    <strong>average points per game by age</strong>. The chart had:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One bar per age</li>
    <li>Plain blue color for all bars</li>
    <li>No interactivity or filters</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="screenshot-note">
    [Screenshot idea: first simple bar chart of PTS vs age]
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Major Changes and Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    As I interacted with the first chart, I realized it answered only part of my question.
    From there I made a few key changes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Metric dropdown:</strong> I added a dropdown that lets the user switch
      between <strong>Points (PTS)</strong>, <strong>Rebounds (REB)</strong>, and
      <strong>Assists (AST)</strong>. This allows comparisons of how different parts of
      a player’s game change with age.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Position filter:</strong> I then added a position filter so you can
      choose between positions like guards, forwards, centers (or all positions).
      This helps explore whether, for example, big men peak differently than guards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimum games played filter:</strong> I added a slider that lets users
      select a minimum number of games played. This was important so that rare
      outliers with only a few games don’t distort the averages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Color improvements:</strong> I updated the color palette so each stat
      uses a distinct accent color that “pops” more and feels more professional,
      instead of all stats sharing a plain blue.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="screenshot-note">
    [Screenshot idea: later version with dropdowns and slider controls visible]
  </p>

  <!-- =========================================
       3. DESIGN DECISIONS
  ========================================== -->
  <p class="section-label">Part 3 – Design Decisions</p>
  <h2>4. Rationale for Design Choices</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Why a Bar Chart?</h3>
  <p>
    Comparing ages directly was the most important task, so I chose a
    <strong>bar chart</strong>. With one bar per age, it is very easy to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>See which age has the highest average value</li>
    <li>Compare neighboring ages and spot where decline begins</li>
    <li>Notice general “shape” trends (rising, peak, falling)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.2 Interaction Design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Stat dropdown:</strong> Lets users compare how different aspects of
      performance (scoring, rebounding, playmaking) change with age beyond just points.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Position filter:</strong> Supports questions like “Do guards have a
      different peak age than centers?” without overwhelming the main view.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimum games slider:</strong> Ensures the averages represent real
      playing time instead of being skewed by players who only appeared in a few games.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4.3 Color & Aesthetics</h3>
  <p>
    I adjusted the colors to make the visualization cleaner and more readable:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Dark background to keep focus on the data and make the bars stand out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each stat uses its own accent color, which helps the user immediately recognize
      whether they are looking at points, rebounds, or assists.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subtle hover effects and labels to keep the design professional but still clear.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- =========================================
       4. FINDINGS
  ========================================== -->
  <p class="section-label">Part 4 – Findings</p>
  <h2>5. Insights & Patterns</h2>

  <h3>5.1 Points vs Age</h3>
  <p>
    When looking at <strong>points per game by age</strong>, the chart suggests that
    players tend to <strong>peak around ages 27–28</strong>. After that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a small decline right after the peak.</li>
    <li>
      A larger drop appears when crossing from about age 30 to 31, showing the more
      serious part of the decline.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.2 Rebounds vs Age</h3>
  <p>
    Rebounds show a similar pattern to points, but the decline seems a bit less severe.
    The performance drops with age, but not quite as sharply as scoring.
  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Assists vs Age</h3>
  <p>
    Assists behave differently:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There is not a clear sharp “peak” like with points — assists stay more
      <strong>steady through the late 20s and early 30s</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The decline becomes more visible only once players reach their mid-30s.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This supports the idea that as players get older, their raw scoring might decline,
    but their playmaking and passing can stay strong for longer.
  </p>

  <h3>5.4 Effect of Minimum Games Filter</h3>
  <p>
    When increasing the minimum games played, the bars sometimes shift and can make
    some older ages look slightly better. This suggests that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Very small sample sizes (players with only a few games) can distort the averages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Filtering out low-game seasons may highlight more “real” rotation players and
      smooth out noisy outliers.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- =========================================
       5. HOW TO USE + AUDIENCE
  ========================================== -->
  <p class="section-label">Part 5 – Usage & Audience</p>
  <h2>6. How to Use the Visualization</h2>

  <p>
    The main goal of the visualization is to let users <strong>explore how NBA
    performance changes with age</strong>, and to make it easy to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>See the peak age for points, rebounds, and assists.</li>
    <li>Compare how quickly different stats decline with age.</li>
    <li>Filter by position and games played to reduce noise.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The intended audience is more on the <strong>casual side</strong>:
    fans, students, and anyone curious about NBA careers and aging, rather than only
    professional analysts. The interface is kept simple with just a few controls so
    it’s easy to understand without reading a manual.
