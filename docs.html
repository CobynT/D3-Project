      <h2>1. Project Overview &amp; Questions</h2>
      <p>
        I chose this NBA dataset because I have always been fascinated with stats and sports. A huge topic of
        discussion in basketball is when players reach their peak and at what age their game starts to decline.
        That idea fits really well with a data visualization project, because we can move beyond opinions and
        actually look at how performance changes with age using real stats.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main big picture question when I started this project was:
        <strong>at what age do NBA players reach their peak and when do they start declining?</strong>
        As I worked, a few related questions also came up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How does this vary by specific stats? For example, if a player gets older and starts to score less,
          do their other stats also start declining, or do things like assists go up as they score less?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there a clear peak age for points, and is that peak age the same (or different) for rebounds and assists?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The final visualization is built around these questions and is designed to make it easy to see how different
        aspects of performance (scoring, rebounding, playmaking) change across ages in the NBA.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Dataset & Preprocessing -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Dataset &amp; Preprocessing</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset comes from a NBA players statistics file and contains several seasons of NBA player
        box score stats. For each player, the dataset includes attributes such as:
        <strong>age</strong>, <strong>games played (GP)</strong>,
        <strong>points per game (PTS)</strong>, <strong>rebounds per game (REB)</strong>,
        and <strong>assists per game (AST)</strong>. These fields are straightforward to understand and are
        standard stats that fans and analysts talk about all the time, which makes the visualization easy to interpret.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the D3 code, I performed the following preprocessing steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Converted numeric fields (<code>age</code>, <code>gp</code>, <code>pts</code>, <code>reb</code>, <code>ast</code>) from strings into numbers.</li>
        <li>Filtered out rows with missing or invalid values.</li>
        <li>Restricted the age range to roughly 18–45 to remove extreme outliers that are not meaningful.</li>
        <li>Grouped players by age and computed the average value for the selected metric (PTS, REB, or AST).</li>
        <li>
          Applied a dynamic filter based on the minimum games played, controlled by a slider, so that users can
          remove players who only appeared in a few games and might skew the averages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These steps ensure that the visualization is based on clean and reasonable data, and that the patterns shown
        are more about real playing time rather than noise from tiny samples.
      </p>

    <!-- 3. Design Process & Sketches -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Design Process &amp; Iteration</h2>
      <p>
        I started very simply with just a basic bar chart that showed <strong>average points per game by age</strong>.
        At first it was a plain blue bar chart that technically worked but looked pretty basic and did not feel very
        polished. That first version still helped confirm that the data was loading correctly and that grouping by
        age to compute averages made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I started adding more features to turn it into a real exploratory tool. One of the main changes
        I remember making was adding the dropdown for <strong>PTS, REB, and AST</strong> so that you can look at
        each of the different stats without changing pages. I also wanted the design to look better and more
        professional, so I changed the colors so that each stat has its own color instead of everything being the
        same blue. Lastly, I added the <strong>minimum games played</strong> slider so that the averages would not
        be dominated by outliers, like players who only played a few games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the design evolved from a single static chart into an interactive view where users can change the
        metric, adjust the games played filter, and see updated trends instantly. The iterative process was mostly
        about asking: “What would make this easier to explore and less misleading?”
      </p>

    <!-- 4. Rationale for Design Choices -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Rationale for Design Choices</h2>
      <p>
        I chose a bar chart by age because comparing each age group directly against the others felt like the most
        natural way to display the data. Age is a discrete value (18, 19, 20, etc.), and with a bar chart it is very
        easy to see which ages are higher or lower at a glance. This matches the main question of “when do players
        peak?” because you can literally see which bar is tallest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dropdown for PTS / REB / AST is important because it lets you compare how different aspects of the game
        are affected by age, instead of only looking at scoring. A player’s scoring might go down over time, but
        their rebounding or assisting could behave differently, and the dropdown makes it trivial to switch between
        these views without reloading or re-creating charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted the minimum games played filter because without it, the averages can be skewed by players with very
        low minutes or only a few appearances. The slider lets you interactively remove those outlier data points
        so that the trends better reflect regular rotation players. Visually, it also helps smooth out some of the
        noisy bumpiness at certain ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        For color, I like the updated scheme because it pops more and feels more like a real sports graphic.
        Each stat has its own color (orange-gold for PTS, green for REB, purple for AST), which makes it clear
        which metric is currently being shown. This avoids confusion and makes it easier to remember what you are
        looking at, especially if you switch back and forth between metrics.

    <!-- 5. Findings & Insights -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. Findings &amp; Insights</h2>
      <p>
        When I look at the visualization for <strong>points per game vs age</strong>, the peak seems to be around
        age <strong>27 or 28</strong>, with a small decline right after that. There is a more noticeable drop once
        you move from around <strong>30 to 31 years old</strong>, which matches the idea that scoring tends to fall
        off as players leave their late twenties and enter their thirties.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>rebounds</strong>, the pattern is similar but the decline looks a bit less severe. Players still
        seem to be effective rebounders into their later twenties and early thirties, and the fall-off is more gradual.
        <strong>Assists</strong> are different. There is almost no strong peak or drop-off from age 28 through the
        later thirties. Assists stay much more steady over that period, and the bigger decline shows up closer to
        age 35. This lines up with the idea that playmaking and basketball IQ can age differently than pure scoring
        or athleticism.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I adjust the <strong>minimum games played</strong> slider, the bars change and sometimes it feels like
        the older ages are favored more when the minimum GP is higher. One possible reason for this is that players
        who are still in the league and playing heavy minutes at older ages tend to be above-average or really good,
        while younger players with very few games could be at the end of the bench or just getting limited minutes.
        Raising the GP filter removes many of those small-sample young players and shifts the averages toward the
        more established contributors at each age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the visualization supports the idea that scoring peaks in the late twenties, rebounds follow a
        similar but slightly softer pattern, and assists are more stable over a longer stretch of a player’s career.
        The interactive controls helped me explore these trends and see how different filters and metrics tell
        slightly different stories about how NBA players age.
